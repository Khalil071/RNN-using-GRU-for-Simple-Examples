RNN using GRU for Simple Examples

Overview

This project demonstrates the application of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) on simple sequential data examples. The goal is to understand the functionality of GRU and how it processes sequential information efficiently.

Features

Implements an RNN with GRU layers.

Works with simple sequential datasets.

Provides insights into how GRU handles dependencies in sequences.

Includes training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
